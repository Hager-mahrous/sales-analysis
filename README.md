# sales finaicial
For analysis project I analyze 3 side :
Financial:
1.Find out that the trend in data is increase year by year

 
2.Data have seasonality pattern that happen every three month the sales get increase for the third month 
   
The most day have sales is saturated and Sunday the weekend days

# Issue in profit that have a loss 
so I get deeper analysis
And discover that after conduct the chi-square test if the states and products influence on the profit and yes they are have significant influence on
Product and profit
